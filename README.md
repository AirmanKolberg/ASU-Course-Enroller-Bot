# The ASU Auto-Enroller Bot

This bot was designed to help you, my fiancÃ©e, and any other ASU student you
know.  As a previous ASU student myself, I often saw that certain courses
were nearly impossible to register, as they often had few seats and were
highly sought out.  However, since students frequently enroll and un-enroll
in classes, this bot aims to take advantage of that.  This bot is intended
to help you keep an eye out for the moments where a spot opens up for a
course, even if only for a matter of a few minutes, allowing you to snipe
that course and take the seat.  Ideally, though, this bot will go further
in future and go forward with the processes of enrolling you in your target
course if and whenever possible, and then notify you through either text
and/or phone call of it doing so.


### To Do:
- Notify via SMS/call when available seats > 0
